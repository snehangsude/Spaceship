## How to play

* Run the application using the Installation section
* Key Bindings:

  * <b>RIGHT</b> Arrow - Move right

## Rules (Know what to expect from the game)

* Try to save the head (1st compartment) & you are good - ignore the body
* The score increases only when any blockade is below the 3rd compartment
* Hitting on <b>SPACE</b> would plant the Repel Bomb directly below the 2nd compartment
* The Repel Bomb works only when near the spaceship
* There are only 10 Repel Bombs so use them scarcely and carefully
* Colliding with the blockade will return you to the base position and your score would be reset to zero (0)
* The Spaceship is limited to move only little less than halfway above


### Improvements planned

* Plans to improve the compartment sensitivity to blockades
* Plans to setup a random ammunition drop for re-fill of ammunition
